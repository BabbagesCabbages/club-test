  Welcome to the Decoding Cancer Virtual Lab!

<h2>What is this lab about?</h2>
<p>In this Virtual Lab, you will follow a patient as she undergoes several tests used to gather critical information about her breast cancer.  You will learn about each test and how the results of each help physicians make decisions about treatment.  Later, you will guide a new patient through some of the tests and use the test results to recommend an appropriate treatment approach.
